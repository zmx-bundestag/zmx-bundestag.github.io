            <div class="partiesText">
                <p>As one of the oldest and largest parties in our Senate, EmoZ is arguably the most influencial and the longest lasting among all other parties. 
                   Upon it's creation way back in time in 2024, it's ideology was to make our school an open, heterogeous, and diverse place. 
                   Now as the party develops, members start to grow a bit apart, with people of both right and left wing, mxing together a moderate right political party. 
                   This party is in favor of having a democratic government, and is quite transversal. 
                   EmoZ currently has the largest amount of seats in office, and its members have been elected as both chancellor and president, making it the most powerful party as well.

                <p>
                    JL started as a corporation that made a wide variety of products, ranging from sport equipments to military research. 
                    However, with the coming of this Senate, and the leaving of their previous leader, the party disassembled, and lost most of its members. 
                    Another quite conservative party, and also in favor of capitalism due it's successful history as a big corporation.

            </div>
            <div class="partiesText">
                <p>
                    Gwo is a party that is created much later than the previous two, yet as influencial due to it's special politics: socialism. 
                    At the dawn of Gwo's creation, the party was in fact a very right-winged party with radical thoughts about race-purging. 
                    But their leader soon realized that this is not good and started his way on becoming scoialist, and even communist. Quite left-winged and extreme. 
                    They advocated for an end to the bourgeoisie rule over our class, and it is in fact their idea to create this government in the first palce.

            </div>
            <div class="partiesText">
                <p>
                    ZouyuE was a quite quiet party, so that we don't really know a lot about them, yet they do present some interesting characteristics. 
                    Having a black member in it's makeup contributed greatly to it's early development, as they advoctaed for labor protection and equal rights for all. 
                    Having such politics makes them good friends with the Gwo party and became socialist as well under Gwo' influence.

            <div class="partiesText">
                <p>
                    Dab is a new party created along with the formation of this government, and although it's just start, we can already have a peek at its political orientation. 
                    This party aims to make everyone happy, and makes a satire about nearly anything in existance. 
                    However, also due to it's very interesting and non-fitting politics, it is quite isolated with only one member. 
                    Having a strong ally like EmoZ can be very beneficial to this party.
