            <div class="partiesText">
                <p>As one of the oldest and largest parties in our Senate, EmoZ is arguably the most influencial and the longest lasting among all other parties. 
                   Upon it's creation way back in time in 2024, it's ideology was to make our school an open, heterogeous, and diverse place. 
                   Now as the party develops, members start to grow a bit apart, with people of both right and left wing, mxing together a moderate right political party. 
                   This party is in favor of having a democratic government, and is quite transversal. 
                   EmoZ currently has the largest amount of seats in office, and its members have been elected as both chancellor and president, making it the most powerful party as well.

                <p>
                    JL started as a corporation that made a wide variety of products, ranging from sport equipments to military research. 
                    However, with the coming of this Senate, and the leaving of their previous leader, the party disassembled, and lost most of its members. 
                    Another quite conservative party, and also in favor of capitalism due it's successful history as a big corporation.

                <p>
                    MMGA (Make ZMX Math Great Again) is a new political party formed by the merge of Gwo and ZoyuE. Advocating for equality, diversity, and prosperity, it seeks to create a peaceful, engaging math education system where all students thrive. While rooted in left-wing liberalism, MMGA blends socialist ideals with conservative pragmatism, positioning itself as a moderate yet progressive force—committed to reform without ideological extremism.

                    Dab is a new party created along with the formation of this government, and although it's just start, we can already have a peek at its political orientation. 
                    This party aims to make everyone happy, and makes a satire about nearly anything in existance. 
                    However, also due to it's very interesting and non-fitting politics, it is quite isolated with only one member. 
                    Having a strong ally like EmoZ can be very beneficial to this party.
